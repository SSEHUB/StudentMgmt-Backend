#### Specifying a semester

Sometimes you might want to filter data by semester, i.e. when you want to retrieve all courses that are taking place in the 
current semester. The Student-Management-System describes semesters with the following format:

Winter semesters will be represented as "wise" followed by the last two digits of the years that the semester will take place in.
Summer semesters will be represented as "sose" followed by the corresponding year.

```typescript
	"wise1920" // winter semester 2019/2020
	"sose2021" // summer semester 2021
```
Summer semesters span from april to september.
Winter semesters span from october to march.
